Hereâ€™s the **README.txt** with all the necessary steps. This will be helpful to quickly resume or restart the app without needing to remember each individual command.

# MT Copy Trading App - Kubernetes Setup Guide

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

* AWS credentials set up and configured
* `kubectl` installed and connected to your Kubernetes cluster
* `aws` CLI installed for AWS interactions
* YAML files for deployments, services, and cleanup

## 2. Setup & Deployment

Use the provided scripts and YAMLs to deploy the backend and frontend in your Kubernetes cluster.

### 2.1. Apply Deployment & Service YAMLs

To deploy the backend and frontend, apply the corresponding YAML files:

```bash
kubectl apply -f backend-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f backend-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f frontend-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f frontend-service.yaml
```

### 2.2. Expose Services

Both backend and frontend services will automatically be exposed via **LoadBalancer** type.
You can check the external IP addresses by running:

```bash
kubectl get svc frontend-service backend-service
```

This will return something like:

```
NAME               TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP                                                               PORT(S)        AGE
backend-service    LoadBalancer   10.100.38.233    a1b2c3d4.elb.amazonaws.com                                                80:31284/TCP   1m
frontend-service   LoadBalancer   10.100.168.199   a4b5c6d7.elb.amazonaws.com                                                80:31851/TCP   1m
```

Use the **EXTERNAL-IP** to access your app in the browser.

---

## 3. Start All Services Script

### 3.1. Run the start script

To deploy both services and fetch the LoadBalancer URLs in one go, use the following script:

```bash
chmod +x start-all.sh
./start-all.sh
```

It will:

* Deploy backend and frontend
* Wait 60 seconds for the LoadBalancer IPs to be assigned
* Show you the **EXTERNAL-IP** URLs to open in your browser.

---

## 4. Clean-up Script

### 4.1. Running the Cleanup

When you're done or want to remove the deployed resources, run the `cleanup.sh` script to delete the Kubernetes deployments, services, and any other associated resources:

```bash
chmod +x cleanup.sh
./cleanup.sh
```

This will remove the frontend, backend, and any associated LoadBalancers.

---

## 5. Monitoring Logs (Optional)

To view logs for any running pod, use the following command:

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

Replace `<pod-name>` with the name of your running pod (you can get it from `kubectl get pods`).

---

## 6. Cost Control (AWS)

Remember, if you're not using the services and need to avoid AWS costs, consider deleting the entire cluster:

```bash
aws eks delete-cluster --name <your-cluster-name>
```

---

### ðŸ’¡ Notes:

* Make sure to adjust any file paths or environment variables for your specific project needs.
* If you face any errors during the process, check pod statuses using `kubectl describe pods` or `kubectl logs`.
